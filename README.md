# geogame
A prototype of a geotagged radioplay game thing.

At this point can:
	-Continually monitor position
	-Compare position to the stored positions
	-Use the stored positions to play the appropriate sound cue (mp3 only)
	-End the game when it reaches the final position
	
At this point, a sample game needs to be built! With actual complex locations and sound cues and a final position. The game is currently in debug mode so it prints the lat/long, which to use for pulling locations.
